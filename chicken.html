                <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
                <ul>2 large chicken breasts cut in half lengthwise</ul>
                <ul>Flour for dredging</ul>
                <ul>1 tablespoon olive oil</ul>
                <ul>2 tablespoons butter divided</ul>
                <ul>1 whole head garlic cloves peeled</ul>
                <ul>1/2 cup chicken broth or stock</ul>
                <ul>1/2 teaspoon lemon juice</ul>
                <ul>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</ul>

                <ul>Salt & pepper to taste</ul>

                <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
                <li>Cut the chicken in half lengthwise so you have 4 smaller cutlets. Sprinkle them with some salt & pepper and coat them in the flour. </li>
                <li>Add the olive oil and 1 tbsp of the butter to a skillet over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, sauté the chicken for 4-5 minutes/side or until it's nice and golden. Take the chicken out of the pan and set it aside.</li>
                <li>Reduce the heat to medium (or even med-low if using cast iron), and add the rest of the butter to the pan. Let it melt and then add the garlic cloves. Cook them for 3-4 minutes, stirring often, until they're lightly browned on the outside. </li>
                <li>Add the chicken broth, lemon juice, and garlic powder to the pan. Let it bubble for around 4 minutes or until the liquid is noticeably reduced.</li>
                <li>Stir in the cream and add the chicken back into the pan. Let it cook for another 5 minutes or so, until the sauce is reduced and the chicken is cooked through. Serve with freshly chopped parsley if you wish.</li>
