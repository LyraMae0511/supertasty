                <ul>2 pieces red chili pepper</ul>
                <ul>Vegetable oil for the wet rub (you can use olive oil)</ul>

                <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
                <li>Let’s begin by making a marinade. Start by diluting some Knorr Pork Cubes and then you can begin combining this with olive oil. Then, rub it all over the pork belly. After 5 minutes, char grill the pork belly until cooked through and cut the belly into thin slices that measure around ½” to 1”. Set these aside.</li>
                <li>Next, place the salmon and vinegar in a glass bowl or any food grade bowl, and soak them for 8 minutes. IMPORTANT TIP: Don’t use an aluminium bowl in soaking the salmon in with the vinegar because when aluminium and acid come in contact, it creates a chemical reaction and will make the food toxic.</li>
                <li>Now, combine the cucumber, green and red bell peppers, and onion. Add the grilled pork belly in and mix thoroughly.</li>
                <li>Give your Sinuglaw a good sprinkle of Knorr Liquid Seasoning and add salt and pepper if preferred.</li>
                <li>Enjoy Sinuglaw Salmon cold as an appetizer or as a snack, it will surely refresh your day.</li>
