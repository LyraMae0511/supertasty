                <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
                <ul>1/2 kilo pork belly (liempo) (ask your butcher to cut your pork belly to 1” strips)</ul>
                <ul>1/4 kilo pork heart</ul>
                <ul>1/4 kilo pork liver</ul>
                <ul>1/2 kilo pork intestine</ul>
                <ul>3 cloves garlic, crushed</ul>
                <ul>1 whole white onion, peeled and minced</ul>
                <ul>3 cups of pork blood (strained)</ul>
                <ul>3 pcs. bay leaf</ul>
                <ul>1/2 cup sukang Iloco (you can use cane vinegar)</ul>
                <ul>2 cups Knorr Pork broth (dilute 1 piece Knorr Pork Cube in 2 cups water)</ul>

                <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
                <li>Let’s begin by boiling the pork heart, pork liver and pork intestine in a stockpot or deep pan filled with water. You then have to cook the meat until they are tender. Remove the pork intestine and discard the stock used for boiling.</li>
                <li>Now, slice the pork heart and pork liver into strips. Set this aside after.</li>
                <li>Next, grab a pan and pour some oil. Make this nice and hot over medium high heat. Bring the garlic and onion into the pan and sauté. When the garlic turns slightly brown and the onions are translucent, throw in the pork belly followed by the pork heart and liver strips. Sauté briefly before adding the Knorr Pork broth, sukang iloco and bay leaves. Bring this to a simmer until the pork belly is tender.</li>
                <li>Now when the liquid has reduced to ¾, gently add the pork blood in and continue simmering until it thickens (add more Knorr pork broth if sauce is too thick). Then, season with Knorr Liquid Seasoning, salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>NWhen you deep fry the pork intestine to a crisp, golden brown color, this dish is done! Be careful, though, because the crispy pork intestine topped on your dinuguan will cause you to eat more!</li>
